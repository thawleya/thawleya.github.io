                <h2>C64</h2>
                <p>The Commodore 64 was my first experience with a home computer. It was one of the first major home computers that had a significant amount of games on it. I was lucky enough for my father to have purchased one in the early 1980s.</p>

                <p>The IBM 386 compatible was the first 'PC' that my family owned. This machine was overspecced at the time with a 25Mhz CPU, 80MB Hard drive and 4MB of RAM. This thing could run Windows but was mostly a DOS based machine.</p>

                <h2>FPS</h2>
                <p>1992 started a massive change in gaming that can still be felt today. Wolfenstein 3D was released adn the fast paced first person shooter genre was created. This was followed by Doom a few years later which introduced the world to local network multiplayer. At this time more powerful computer were being developed and the PC was starting to gain dominance.</p>

                <p>In the early 1990s I went online to bulletin board services (not the Internet) and also played Doom with friends over the phone line.
                The modem was a whopping 2400bps (bits per second). Current fibre is 100Mbps or 100,000,000bps.</p>

                In the early 2000s NZ started offering broadband ADSL internet. This was the first permanent internet connection available for homes. Speeds were an amazing 128Kbps (0.128Mbps). This was a huge deal as it meant that you could be online 24/7 and not have to worry about someone picking up the phone and disconnecting you from the internet.

                After University I entered into a console gaming phase. First picking up the Original XBox. This was the stage where consoles were becoming mainstream and better value than a gaming PC. People even predicted the death of the gaming PC.

                In 2004 Valve released Half-Life 2. This was the first digital game I purchased and I made the move to Steam. There was a time when I owned almost every game that was available on Steam.

                These really took off in the mid 2000s with the Apple iPhone leading the way. I appreciate that Apple devices are good devices but are overpriced for what they are. I resisted Andoird for a while, showing my loyalty to Nokia and even tried a Windows Mobile phone for a while. When Android released their play store and GPS and mobile data became common place I made the switch and never looked back.

                A lot of these companies get you locked into their ecosystem so that it is hard to make the changeto other brands.

                Game consoles made a resurgance in the late 2000s. The Wii opened up gaming to people who had never traditionally gamed before. Much like smartphones opened up casual gaming.

                There was a time when streaming media wasn't common place. In the UK services like BBC iPlayer led the way. Around this time the retail shops selling music and movies started to die off.

                    In my opinion the nVidia Shield is the best option out there. Smart boxes are a better investment than Smart TVs as they are updated for a longer period of time.

                The 2010s saw me return to PC gaming as the value for money was a lot better than the new consoles like PS4 and Xbox One.

                The Switch was the first new console of the current generation I purchased. This was for it's porability and in my view it's the best of the current generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                Xbox really stuffed up this generation. Search for their E3 announcement presentation for how wrong they got it. The gamepass subscription service has managed to provide a unique offering for gamers.</p>
                <p>
                Where the Switch and PS4 have realyl show ntheir strength this generation is in their console exclusives.</p>
